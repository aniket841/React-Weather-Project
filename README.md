# React-Weather-Project
This is my first react project.A responsive React-based Weather App that provides real-time weather information for any city.  Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.  Features a clean, user-friendly interface with dynamic background images based on weather conditions.
